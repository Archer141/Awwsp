                At about 100 calories apiece, bananas are a great source of easy-to-digest sugar and natural electrolytes. “They may not be as convenient as bars or gels, but they’re a good option for people who are looking for a natural, less-processed alternative that basically does the same thing,” says Pluhar. They’re also a favorite post-event recovery food, and for good reason: One medium banana contains 422 mg of potassium, which your body needs to regulate fluids and prevent muscle cramps and spasms. Because you sweat out potassium during physical activity, it’s important to replenish as soon as possible afterward.
